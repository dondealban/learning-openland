# Learning the OpenLand R package
This is a repository set up as my personal exercise for learning land use/cover change analysis of time-series data using the [OpenLand](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OpenLand/index.html) R package. It can also be used as a tutorial for someone interested in learning spatiotemporal land use/cover change analysis for their research projects. Here, I implemented the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OpenLand/vignettes/openland_vignette.html) on how to use OpenLand package developed by the authors, Reginal Exavier and Peter Zeilhofer.
